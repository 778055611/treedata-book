# Welcome {-}

<img class="cover" src="book-cover.png" width="210" height="297" /> This is the online work-in-progress book of "Data Integration, Manipulation and Visualization of Phylogenetic Trees". This book gives your all the details of using the ggtree package suite to handle tree with data. The book is written by Guangchuang Yu.

# Preface {-}

The book is meant as a guide for data integration, manipulation and visualization of phylogenetic trees using a suite of R packages, `r CRANpkg("tidytree")`, `r Biocpkg("treeio")` and `r Biocpkg("ggtree")`. Hence, if you are starting to read this book, we assume you have a working knowledge of how to use R and `r CRANpkg("ggplot2")`. 

The development of the `r Biocpkg("ggtree")` package started during my Ph.D study at the University of Hong Kong. I joined the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases under the supervison of Yi Guan and Tommy Lam. I was asked to provide assistance to modify the newick tree string to incorporate some additional information, such as amino acid substitutions, in the internal node labels of the phylogeny for visualization. I wrote an R script to do it and soon realized that most phylogenetic tree visualization software can only display one type of data through node label. Basically, we cannot display two data variables at the same time for comparative analysis. In order to produce tree graphs displaying different types of branch/node associated information, such as bootstrap values and substitutions, people mostly relied on post-processing image software. This situation motivates me to develop `r Biocpkg("ggtree")`. First of all, I think a good user interface must fully support the `r CRANpkg("ggplot2")` syntax, which allows us to draw graphs by superimposing layers. In this way, simple graphs are simple, and complex graphs are just a combination of simple layers, which are easy to generate. 



## How to read this book

## Structure of the book


+ Part 1 (Tree data input, output and manipulation) describes `r Biocpkg("treeio")` package for tree data input and output, and `r CRANpkg("tidytree")` package for tree data manipulation.
+ Part 2 (Tree data visualization and annotation) introduces tree visualization and annotation using grammar of graphic syntax implemented in the `r Biocpkg("ggtree")` package. It emphasizes on presenting tree associated data on the tree.
+ Part 3 (ggtree extensions) introduces ggtreeExtra for presenting data on circular layout trees and other extensions including MicrobiotaProcess and ggnetworx *etc.*.
+ Part 4 (Miscellaneous topics) describes utilities provided by the `r Biocpkg("ggtree")` package suite and presents a set of reproducible examples.




## Software information and conventions


The basic R session information when compiling this book is as follows:

```{r tidy=FALSE}
xfun::session_info(
    c('ape', 'aplot', 'ggplot2', 'ggtree', 
      'ggtreeExtra', 'tidytree', 'treeio'),
    dependencies = FALSE)
```

Package names are in bold text (*e.g.*, **ggtree**), and function names are followed by parentheses (*e.g.*, `treeio::read.beast()`). The doulbe-colon operator (`::`) means accessing an object from a package.
