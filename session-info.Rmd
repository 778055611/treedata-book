The book was written using R Markdown and was compiled by `r CRANpkg("bookdown")` package. Here is the session information on the system on which this thesis was compiled:

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
## options(width=90)
devtools::session_info()
if (FALSE) {
  sessionInfo() %>% capture.output %>%
    `[`(., -c(5:8)) %>% paste('\n') %>% cat
}
## options(width=80)
```
